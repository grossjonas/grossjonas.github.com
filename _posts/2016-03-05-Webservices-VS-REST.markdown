[WIP]

Tools for html presentations:
* [revealjs](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js)

nice system: you have slide by slides and on each slide you can go down to another slide. so if you want to prepare going deeper on a topic just add a few "down slides".

* [impressjs](https://github.com/impress/impress.js/)

fancy

* [deckjs](https://github.com/imakewebthings/deck.js)

seems dead

* [Slide Presentation Framework](https://github.com/briancavalier/slides)

seems even more dead


I'm feed up. It's reveal-js, because it looks most reasonable.


Hmm .. it seems to be used on [slides.com](http://slides.com), which is free for public presentations. Maybe I should try that.
