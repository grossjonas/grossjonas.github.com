As of today I spent 2 evenings searching for one simple option.

But first things first. I am configuring a Cent OS 6.4 VPS to host a few services. Most if not all of which have LDAP-support. So I wanted slapd, the openldap daemon of Cent OS, to listen only locally.

In the process of setting up that daemon I followed [this great walkthrough by 6tech](http://www.6tech.org/2013/01/ldap-server-and-centos-6-3/).

In order to restrict ldap to localhost some further infomation is needed. 
* How does the openldap-server choose its interface (and set its ports)?
* Where do you configure that?

Basic information on its listener can be found  in the [openldap documentation](http://www.openldap.org/doc/admin24/runningslapd.html). The interesting part is the one about the '-h' option.

Basically the server has 3 interfaces:
1. the normal ldap interface (URL: ldap:/...)
2. ldap over SSL (URL: ldaps:/...)
3. IPC(Unix domain socket) (URL: ldapi:/...)

In Cent OS 6.4 these are configured in 

``` bash
vim /etc/sysconfig/ldap
```

With the help of the comments this file is pretty self-explanatory. So I changed every 'yes' to 'no' and added:

``` ini
SLAPD_URLS="ldap://127.0.0.1 ldaps://127.0.0.1"
```
